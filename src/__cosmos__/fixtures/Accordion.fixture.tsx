    <AccordionContent>
      Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart
      contract functionality. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by
      market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum enables developers
      to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and create

    <AccordionTrigger>What are Smart Contracts?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the
      agreement directly written into code. They run on the Ethereum
      Virtual Machine (EVM) and automatically execute when predetermined
      conditions are met, without intermediaries.

      What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The EVM is a runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
      It is a Turing-complete virtual machine that allows anyone to
      execute arbitrary EVM bytecode. Every Ethereum node runs on the
      EVM to maintain consensus across the blockchain.

      Ethereum 2.0 is an upgrade to the Ethereum network that improves
      its scalability, security, and sustainability. The key change is
      the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS)
      consensus mechanism, which significantly reduces energy
      consumption.

      Layer 2 solutions are scaling solutions built on top of the
      Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1) to increase transaction throughput and
      reduce fees. Examples include Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups, and
      side chains, which process transactions off-chain and then settle
